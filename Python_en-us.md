### Functions

Functions are an integral part of Python programming language. They are essentially a block of code that a specific task and can be from anywhere in the code. Functions provide a way to break down large, complex into smaller, more manageable pieces. By writing functions, you reuse code and make your code easier to read and maintain. Python has many built-in functions that are available for use, such print() and len(), but you can also create your custom functions. To create a function, you must define it the keyword "def" followed the function name, any parameters, and a colon. The code block is then indented below the definition. Once defined, you can call the function using name and appropriate arguments, if.

#### Defining Functions

Defining Functions in Python a fundamental concept essential to programming and is one of the most features of Python. Functions are code blocks that can be called multiple times a program. Python functions can take arguments, perform an operation and return a value if required.

#### Arguments and

In Python, arguments are values passed to functions for their use in executing the function. There are two types of arguments in Python positional and keyword. Positional arguments are passed based on their position in the function call, keyword arguments are passed with keyword that matches the function parameter. Additionally, Python also default argument values, which are used when an argument is not passed in the function call. It is important to note that the order in which arguments are passed to a function matters, and incorrect arguments or arguments in wrong order can result in errors. Proper use of arguments can greatly enhance the functionality and flexibility of Python programs

### Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code manipulate that data.
